# **Azure AI Document Intelligence Code Samples**

> Note: on July 2023, the Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer service was renamed to Azure AI Document Intelligence. Any mentions of Form Recognizer or Document Intelligence in documentation refer to the same Azure service.

Welcome! Azure AI Document Intelligence is a cloud service that uses machine learning to analyze text and structured data from your documents. 

- Code samples for each language's SDK are in the links below. The first step is to select to choose one (default **Python**).

## **Features**
Azure AI Document Intelligence is a cloud-based [Azure AI service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/?view=doc-intel-3.1.0) that enables you to build intelligent document processing solutions. Massive amounts of data, spanning a wide variety of data types, are stored in forms and documents. Document Intelligence enables you to effectively manage the velocity at which data is collected and processed and is key to improved operations, informed data-driven decisions, and enlightened innovation.

## **Prerequisites**
* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai-services/).
* [Python 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/). Your Python installation should include [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). You can check if you have pip installed by running `pip --version` on the command line. Get pip by installing the latest version of Python.
* Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your preferred IDE. For more information, see [Getting Started with Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).
* An Azure AI services or Document Intelligence resource. Once you have your Azure subscription, Create a [single-service](https://aka.ms/single-service) or [multi-service](https://aka.ms/multi-service) resource.
    You can use the free pricing tier (F0) to try the service and upgrade to a paid tier for production later.
* [Get endpoint and keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-3.1.0#get-endpoint-url-and-keys) to your Document Intelligence resource.

## **Setup**

1. Open a terminal window in your local environment and install the Azure AI Document Intelligence client library for Python with [pip][pip]:

```bash
pip install azure-ai-formrecognizer==3.3.0
```

2. Clone or download this sample repository
3. Open the sample folder in Visual Studio Code or your IDE of choice.

## Running the samples
  
1. Open a terminal window and `cd` to the directory that the samples are saved in.
2. Set the environment variables specified in the sample file you wish to run.
3. Below are some sample code guidelines so that you can choose the sample according to your needs.  
**Note**: For more samples, see **[Azure SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/azure-ai-formrecognizer_3.3.0/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/samples)** and **[Async Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/azure-ai-formrecognizer_3.3.0/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/samples/v3.2_and_later/async_samples)**.

### **Pre/post processing samples**
There are usually some pre/post processing steps that are needed to get the best results from the Document Intelligence models. These steps are not part of the Document Intelligence service, but are common steps that are needed to get the best results. The following samples show how to do these steps.  
**Note**：Applies to **all versions**.    

>**[sample_disambiguate_similar_characters.ipynb](Python(v3.1)/Pre_or_post_processing_samples/sample_disambiguate_similar_characters.ipynb)** and **[sample_disambiguate_similar_characters.py](Python(v3.1)/Pre_or_post_processing_samples/sample_disambiguate_similar_characters.py)**
