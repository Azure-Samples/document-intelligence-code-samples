## Features

Azure AI Document Intelligence is a cloud-based [Azure AI service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/?view=doc-intel-4.0.0) that enables you to build intelligent document processing solutions. Massive amounts of data, spanning a wide variety of data types, are stored in forms and documents. Document Intelligence enables you to effectively manage the velocity at which data is collected and processed and is key to improved operations, informed data-driven decisions, and enlightened innovation.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai-services/).
* [Python 3.8 or later](https://www.python.org/). Your Python installation should include [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). You can check if you have pip installed by running `pip --version` on the command line. Get pip by installing the latest version of Python.
* Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your preferred IDE.   For more information, see [Getting Started with Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).
* An Azure AI services or Document Intelligence resource.  Once you have your Azure subscription,Create a [single-service](https://aka.ms/single-service) or [multi-service](https://aka.ms/multi-service) resource.
    You can use the free pricing tier (F0) to try the service and upgrade to a paid tier for production later.
* [Get endpoint and keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0#get-endpoint-url-and-keys) to your Document Intelligence resource.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) samples

The Layout model provides various building blocks like tables, paragraphs, section headings, etc. that can enable different semantic chunking strategies of the document. With semantic chunking in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), it will be more efficient in storage and retrieval, together with the benefits of improved relevance and enhanced interpretability. The following samples show how to use the Layout model to do semantic chunking and use the chunks to do RAG.  
**Note**：Only available for **v4.0 (2024-02-29-preview)** .
